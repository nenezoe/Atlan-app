### :üéá :Optimization :
- Tree shaking is the process of removing unused or dead code from the bundles. This is especially important when using utility libraries like Lodash where you do not need all features of the imported library.
- Prefetching is a way of informing the browser about the resources that are likely to be requested and fetching them before they are necessary. This is done once the required resources for the current page are loaded and when the browser is in idle state.
- Progressive Web Apps are reliable, fast, and engaging. They load quickly even in slow networks and are high-performant
-  Avoided Inline Function Definition in the Render Function.
-  Avoided using Index as Key for map
